# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are argument values that are utilized by class Components. Unlike a parameters, props have a predetermined value that is passed when called on. Props are also a way for objects in react to pass data up and down. This behavior helps to support DRY coding and keeps code clean and more organized overall. 

  Researched answer: Props are also valuable for modifying data for different component. They allow for dynamic coding, so that each component using the prop will receive its own data. 



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event refers to any action that takes place in an application interface. These events can cover a multitude of different changes that occur in the application. These changes can range from user interaction, such as a click, to changes in data and execution of code within the interface. 

  Researched answer: Events provide a sense of iteration and automation in code. The system provides a data change for the code to react to. Events also behave differently depending on the language or environment they occur in. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is coding under the premise that everything piece of code is an object. It differs from functional programming because the two methods operate on different principles. Functional programming operates under the premise that every piece of code is derived from functions. It would be similar to a how adjectives and adverbs are used. Object oriented programming represents adjectives, which are focused around nouns or "objects". Functional programming represents adverbs, which are focused around verbs or "functions". 

  Researched answer: Both methods use different ways to store and manipulate data. OOP seems to use encapsulation to hide its data. FP focuses more around permanent data or functions to be utilized. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float represents any number with a decimal point. Integers refer to any whole number. 

  Researched answer: When integers interact, they will only produce whole numbers. Floats will be more mathematically accurate. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return means that code will execute on its own. No keywords or special symbols are needed for activation of code. In a sense, the expression of code is its own return. An example would be the arrow function expression. Only the expression is required in the arrow function. No keywords or symbols are required to direct the code. On the other hand, most languages require an activator or return. A good example of this would be 'return' or '{}' in javascript. These things both direct the code in some way and are necessary for the code to execute successfully. 

  Researched answer: Implicit returns tend to be low maintenance, but better for shorter code. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: A variable denoted by @, that has data which is only available to the object the variable is referred to. 

2. PostgreSQL: An open source, database warehouse for different applications. 

3. Ruby on Rails: A web app that provides a default framework for full stack development. 

4. ORM: Manipulates data using object oriented programming. Similar to 'this' in javascript.

5. Active Record: A layer of code that runs between the database and logic.
